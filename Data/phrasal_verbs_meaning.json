The OED suggests that it derives ultimately from the noun cock, but gives no further detail. The nature of the earliest citation suggests that this expression entered the wider language from military slang, making etymologies from typesetting or archery (see below) seem unlikely.\nThe term is sometimes attributed to the days of manual typesetting, when a letter that had become wedged slightly higher than the other letters on the line was said to be \u201ccocked up\u201d.\nAnother claim relates to medieval archery. One of the three feathers on an arrow is a cock\u2019s feather. If the arrow was incorrectly placed on the bow for drawing and release, the arrow would go off course because of the cock\u2019s feather being up and therefore the arrow positioned wrongly on the bow.

It may have been because freshly woven cotton has a natural fuzzy nap that means it can be sheared without first having to artificially raise it\". The word \"cotton\" is derived from the Arabic word \"qutn\". Arabic traders supplied the Western world with cotton from Indus Valley, where it had grown since 5000 BCE. The word was then applied to the fine finishing of any cloth.  With the boom in the cotton industry it came to represent success especially financial success. \"By about 1600, 'to cotton together' 'or cotton with' a person meant you got on well together. It has plausibly been suggested it came from the use of mixtures of cotton and other fibres in clothing. A little later, cotton up meant to strike up a friendship. In the early 1800s, to cotton to somebody implied that you were drawn or attached to that person.
